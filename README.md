# Password Generator Application

This is a **JavaFX-based Password Generator** that allows users to generate strong passwords based on customizable criteria. Users can select options such as uppercase letters, numbers, special characters, uniqueness, and starting with a letter.



## Installation & Setup
Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:

Java JDK 17+ (or later)
JavaFX SDK (if using standalone JavaFX)

## Running the Application
Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA or any other IDEA used.
Ensure JavaFX is properly set up:
Go to File > Project Structure > Libraries and add JavaFX.
Run HelloApplication.java to start the application.
## How It Works
The user selects password options using checkboxes.
A Spinner allows selecting the password length.
